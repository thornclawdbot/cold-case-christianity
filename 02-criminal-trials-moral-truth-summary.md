## One-Sentence Summary

A homicide detective argues from courtroom experience that objective moral truth must exist and be grounded in God, because legal systems reveal a persistent gap between what is legally permissible and what is morally right.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Law and morality are different** - Trials expose behaviors that are legal but immoral (adultery, tax loopholes), proving our moral intuitions transcend legal standards.

2. **Humans are "decent describers, but historically inept prescribers"** - We can recognize moral truth but cannot create it without bias.

3. **Cultural relativism fails** - Hitler saw himself as morally upright; if morality is culturally defined, his assessment was correct within his framework—which we reject.

4. **We appeal to transcendent standards** - Even the UN implicitly assumes moral truths exist "above" human law when condemning human rights abuses.

5. **God is the necessary foundation** - Only a transcendent Law Giver can explain why moral truths apply to all cultures at all times.

## Critical Insight

"Transcendent moral truths require a transcendent moral truth Giver. God alone transcends every culture and people group. As a result, God is the most reasonable explanation for the transcendent source of objective moral truth."

## Practical Application

When someone claims morality is "just cultural," ask: "Would you say Nazi Germany was morally good?" Their instinctive answer reveals they believe in objective moral standards beyond culture.
