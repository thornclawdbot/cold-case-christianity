## One-Sentence Summary

Wallace argues Jesus claimed divinity through implied statements ("Before Abraham was, I am"), divine actions (forgiving sins, accepting worship), and "I am" statements—actions His Jewish audience understood as blasphemous.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Jesus didn't say "I am God" explicitly** - But He didn't need to; His Jewish audience understood His claims.

2. **"Before Abraham was, I am" caused lethal outrage** - Using God's name from Exodus 3:14 was clear blasphemy to His hearers.

3. **Jesus did what only God can do** - Forgave sins, accepted worship, claimed authority over Law and Sabbath.

4. **His trial reveals His claims** - He quoted Daniel 7 ("Son of Man" receiving worship), causing the high priest to tear his garments.

5. **He was executed for blasphemy** - If His claims weren't clear, His execution makes no historical sense.

## Critical Insight

"Jesus didn't have to say the exact phrase 'I am God' any more than a suspect has to say, 'I committed the crime' for investigators to prove it. The evidence itself says it for Him."

## Evidence Summary

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Divine name | "I AM" (John 8:58) |
| Divine authority | Forgave sins |
| Divine worship | Accepted worship from Thomas |
| Divine titles | "I am the bread of life," etc. |
| Divine position | Right hand of Power (Daniel 7) |

## The Logic

Either Jesus was who He claimed, OR He was a liar/lunatic. His consistent life, death, and resurrection point to deity.
