## Script

**[Scene: Office setting, person at desk, late afternoon light]**

**Hook (0-3s):**
POV: It's 9 AM on a Friday and you've already accepted that the weekend has officially started

**Body (3-15s):**
*Dramatically opens laptop*
Me: *Does a little shimmy* "We are OFFICIALLY in weekend mode"
Coworker: "It's literally 9 AM"
Me: *Points to window* "The sun is out. The birds are singing. This is a religious experience."
*Pretends to type important document but it's just me rearranging desktop icons for 20 minutes*

**Call to Action (15-20s):**
If you know, you know. Drop a 🐝 if you're riding this Friday energy all the way to Monday!

## Image Prompt

A vibrant, golden-hour office scene with warm sunlight streaming through windows. A person at a desk with a playful, slightly mischievous expression, arms raised in a celebratory pose. Their laptop screen shows colorful desktop icons. Soft bokeh effect with subtle sparkle overlays. Warm color palette with oranges, yellows, and soft whites. Cinematic lighting, slightly overexposed for a dreamy, aspirational feel. High-energy, uplifting mood.
