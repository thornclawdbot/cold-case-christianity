## One-Sentence Summary

Two concise apologetic responses that quickly refute relativism by showing the statement "there are no objective truths" is self-refuting, and that some claims (like medical facts) are clearly objective regardless of opinion.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **The objection self-destructs** - Claiming "no objective truths exist" is itself an objective truth claim.

2. **Not all claims are equal** - "Chocolate chip cookies are best" is subjective; "Isoniazid cures TB" is objective and verifiable.

3. **We naturally distinguish objective and subjective** - Even relativists treat some claims as true/false.

4. **Quick responses enable gospel conversations** - Brief, memorable answers keep conversations moving.

## The Two Responses at a Glance

| Response | Approach | Key Question |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| #1 | Self-refutation | "Is that statement objectively true?" |
| #2 | Object vs. Subject | "Is this grounded in an object or a person?" |

---

## Practical Use

When someone says "There are no objective truths":
1. Ask: "Are you sure? Is that objectively true?"
2. Or: "So if I said Isoniazid doesn't cure TB, would that be as true as saying it does?"

---

## Critical Insight

"To say that 'there are no objective truth claims,' is to deny this claim about Isoniazid. Have you considered how dangerous that approach would be?"
