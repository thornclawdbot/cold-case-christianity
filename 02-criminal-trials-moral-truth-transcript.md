## Summary

Wallace, a cold-case homicide detective, uses his courtroom experience to argue that objective moral truth exists and must be grounded in God. He highlights the gap between what is legally permissible and what is morally right.

**Key Points:**
1. **Legality ≠ Morality** - Criminal trials reveal behaviors that are legal but immoral (e.g., adultery).
2. **Culture cannot define morality** - If morality were culturally defined, Hitler's Germany would have been "morally good" by its own standards.
3. **Transcendent moral truths exist** - We appeal to something beyond human law when condemning injustice.
4. **God is the most reasonable explanation** - Only a transcendent Law Giver can ground objective moral truth.

## Key Arguments

**On Legal vs. Moral:**
"Most of us would agree laws such as these are (and have been) inadequate in determining moral truth... Adultery, for example, is legally permissible in our country yet morally reprehensible."

**On Cultural Relativism:**
"Hitler, for example, would most certainly have described himself (and the society he led) as morally upright. If history is any guide, humans cannot be trusted to define objective moral truth; we typically favor our own desires over others."

**On the "Law Above the Law":**
"Transcendent moral truths require a transcendent moral truth Giver. God alone transcends every culture and people group. As a result, God is the most reasonable explanation for the transcendent source of objective moral truth."

## The Core Distinction

| Legal Truth | Moral Truth |
|-------------|-------------|
| Defined by governments | Transcends all humanity |
| Varies by culture | Universal |
| Can be manipulated | Immutable |
| Describes what is permitted | Prescribes what ought to be |

## Why This Matters

- We instinctively appeal to moral standards beyond human law
- The United Nations appeals to "something" when condemning human rights abuses
- Without God, there is no objective standard to judge any culture's behavior
