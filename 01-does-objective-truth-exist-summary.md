## One-Sentence Summary

This article argues that objective truth exists and can be known, refuting postmodern relativism through everyday examples, philosophical analysis, and the observation that world religions make mutually exclusive claims that cannot all be true.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Truth is self-evident in daily life** - We act on objective truths (is the street safe to cross?) even when we claim to doubt truth philosophically.

2. **Religious pluralism is logically incoherent** - World religions contradict each other on fundamental issues (Does God exist? Is God personal? Was Jesus God or just a man?); they cannot all be correct.

3. **Denials of truth are self-refuting** - "There is no truth" is itself a truth claim; "Truth cannot be known" presumes we can know something.

4. **Knowledge requires justification** - Not just true belief, but belief supported by sufficient evidence that outweighs alternatives.

5. **God is the foundation of truth** - Jesus claimed to be "the truth," and Scripture affirms that God's word is truth.

## Critical Insight

"We may 'know' OF something that is false, but what we 'know' is that it IS false. To actually 'know' something is to 'know' that it is TRUE."

## Practical Application

The author uses the courtroom analogy: we presume innocence until evidence proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Similarly, we should hold to prior beliefs until new evidence sufficiently outweighs them.
