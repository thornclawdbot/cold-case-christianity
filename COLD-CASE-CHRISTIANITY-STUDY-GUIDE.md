## Key Themes

### 1. Evidence-Based Faith
Wallace argues that faith should be based on evidence, not blind acceptance. He distinguishes between:
- **Unreasonable Belief** - Holding beliefs despite contrary evidence
- **Blind Belief** - Accepting without evidence
- **Forensic Belief** - Evidence-based faith (most reliable)

### 2. Eyewitness Testimony
The Gospels were written by eyewitnesses or based on eyewitness accounts. Wallace examines:
- How eyewitness testimony works in criminal investigations
- Why the Gospel writers' testimonies are reliable
- How to evaluate conflicting eyewitness accounts

### 3. Circumstantial Evidence
The Gospels contain circumstantial evidence that supports their reliability:
- Undesigned coincidences
- Historicity of details
- Eyewitness fingerprints

### 4. The Resurrection
The central claim of Christianity is Jesus' resurrection. Wallace examines:
- The evidence for the empty tomb
- The appearances of Jesus
- Alternative explanations and why they fail

### 5. Bias and Reliability
Wallace addresses the objection that Gospel writers were biased:
- Bias doesn't mean false
- Eyewitnesses can be biased and accurate
- The "admission of fault" principle

## Key Arguments

### On Faith and Evidence
"Even with a forensic approach to faith, you're still going to have unanswered questions. You'll still need to take steps of trust. But here is what you can do: you can ensure that the step of faith you're taking is neither unreasonable nor blind."

### On Eyewitness Testimony
"When I evaluate eyewitness testimony in a trial, I don't expect perfection. I expect consistency, even when the witness is testifying about something that happened years earlier."

### On the Resurrection
"The Resurrection is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. If it didn't happen, Christianity is false. But the evidence for the Resurrection is strong—stronger than many people realize."
