## Summary

Wallace argues that Jesus did claim to be God, not by saying "I am God" explicitly, but through His actions, statements, and acceptance of worship—all of which His Jewish audience understood as divine claims.

**Key Points:**
1. **"Before Abraham was, I am"** (John 8:58) - Using God's name from Exodus 3:14
2. **Forgave sins** - Only God has authority to forgive sins
3. **Accepted worship** - Angels and apostles always redirected worship to God; Jesus received it
4. **"I am" statements** - Bread of life, light of the world, good shepherd, resurrection and life
5. **Trial testimony** - Claimed to be "Son of Man" from Daniel 7, receiving worship and authority

## Key Arguments

**On Communication Style:**
"Detectives know that truth often hides in what's implied, not explicitly spoken... Jesus left behind an abundance of evidence of His divinity. The question is: are we willing to follow that evidence where it leads?"

**On "I AM" Statement:**
"Jesus wasn't merely claiming to exist before Abraham; He was equating Himself with the eternal 'I AM.' This wasn't misunderstood speech—it was a declaration so clear that His audience responded with lethal outrage."

**On Forgiving Sins:**
"They knew that only God has the authority to forgive sins. Yet Jesus proved His divine credentials by healing the man right in front of them. It was not just mercy—it was divine authority on display."

**On Accepting Worship:**
"When Thomas saw the risen Christ and exclaimed, 'My Lord and my God,' Jesus didn't correct him. He affirmed him. This response wasn't arrogance—it was truth."

## Evidence of Jesus' Divinity

| Action/Statement | Why It Proves Divinity |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Before Abraham was, I am" | Used God's name (Exodus 3:14) |
| Forgave sins | Only God can forgive sins |
| Accepted worship | Never redirected to the Father |
| "I am" statements | Old Testament divine titles |
| Son of Man in Daniel 7 | Receives eternal worship/authority |
| Didn't correct Thomas | "My Lord and my God" |

## The Verdict

"Either Jesus was who He said He was—or He was a liar or lunatic making claims that violate monotheistic belief. But when His words, deeds, resurrection, and fulfilled prophecy line up consistently, the logical verdict points to deity."

---

## Critical Insight

"Jesus didn't have to say the exact phrase 'I am God' any more than a suspect has to say, 'I committed the crime' for investigators to prove it. The evidence itself says it for Him."

## Why This Matters

Jesus was executed for blasphemy—claiming to be God. If He wasn't making these claims, His execution makes no historical sense.
