## One-Sentence Summary

A homicide detective argues that faith should be evidence-based (forensic) rather than unreasonable (against evidence) or blind (without evidence), making it defensible and transformative.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Unreasonable belief is dangerous** - Clinging to beliefs despite contrary evidence is "stubborn denial dressed up as devotion."

2. **Blind belief is risky** - Accepting faith without examining evidence leaves you vulnerable when challenges come.

3. **Forensic belief is reliable** - Evidence-based faith provides confidence and intellectual engagement ability.

4. **Forensic faith requires steps of trust** - No one can remove all doubt, but you can ensure your faith step is reasonable.
