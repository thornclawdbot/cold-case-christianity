## Summary

This article addresses the postmodern claim that objective truth does not exist. Wallace argues that truth is real and knowable, using both philosophical reasoning and everyday examples.

**Key Points:**
1. **Truth exists in the physical world** - When crossing a street, either it's safe or it isn't. Both realities cannot exist simultaneously.
2. **World religions make contradictory claims** - Buddhism says no personal God; Christianity says there is. These cannot both be true.
3. **Two objections to truth:**
   - Ontological: Truth doesn't exist (all truth is perspectival)
   - Epistemological: Truth exists but can't be known
4. **Both objections are self-refuting** - Claiming "no truth exists" is itself a truth claim.
5. **Knowledge = Properly Justified True Belief** - Wallace explains the classic philosophical definition.
6. **Evidential Sufficiency** - Accept new beliefs only when evidence outweighs contrary evidence.
7. **Jesus affirmed objective truth** - Scripture passages showing Jesus claimed to be "the truth."

## Key Arguments

**On Religious Pluralism:**
"ALL of these world religions may be wrong about what they believe... but it is simply crazy to say that all of the world's religions are correct at the same time; their truth claims are opposed to one another!"

**On the Nature of Truth:**
"Truth is rather brutish in the way that it imposes itself on our lives. It's like a safe dropping from a ten-story building; we either step aside or get crushed."

**On Subjective Truth Claims:**
"When someone says that all truth depends on your point of view, they want us to believe that this statement is true and not simply their own point of view!"

**On Knowing Truth:**
"Personally, I am not interested in simple happiness and satisfaction. I am interested in the objective, objective truth about God, because only this truth has long term significance."

## Theories of Truth Discussed

1. **Pragmatic Theory** - "Truth is what works" (rejected - death doesn't "work" for us but is true)
2. **Empiricist Theory** - "Truth is what we sense" (rejected - sensory experience varies between people)
3. **Emotivist Theory** - "Truth is what we feel" (rejected - feelings can be irrational)
4. **Correspondence Theory** - "Truth corresponds to reality" (accepted - the classic definition)

## Personal Anecdotes

- **Grandmother's story** - Grew up in Naples where everyone agreed on truth, then immigrated to multicultural US where she learned disagreement about truth ≠ absence of truth
- **College philosophy class** - A teacher claimed no objective truth but enforced objective class rules (start times, assigned books, true/false tests)
- **Telescope story** - Friend looked for Mars on wrong date; sincere effort with wrong information is still wrong
